     <strong>Bag of Santa Claus</strong>
</p>
<p>
When New Year is coming everybody waits the visit of Santa Claus. He 
comes with a huge bag of gifts, and you can take any. But how to 
make the best choose - so Santa gets them out of the bag one at a 
time, and if you don't like it - puts it again to bag forever. What 
a disappointment, when the last thing from the bag is a doll, and 
you have already refused to pirate hat because hoping to get a saber!
</p>
<p>
When this happened with John, Dad told him - don't worry, I teach 
you how to choose a better gift. Did you knew how much gifts in the 
bag?

<p> Second: </p>
    <pre class="brush: python">
def choose_good_gift(total_gifts, bag, accept_gift):
    for i, gift in enumerate(iter(bag())):
        if i == total_gifts // 2:  # on the middle
            accept_gift()
            return
