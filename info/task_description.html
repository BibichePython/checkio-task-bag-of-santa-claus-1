    When the New Year is coming, all the kids wait for a visit from Santa Claus. He comes with a huge bag of gifts, and
    you can choose any one of them. But how to make the best choice? Santa takes gifts out of the bag one at a time, and
    if you don't like it, he puts it back into the bag and doesn’t take it out again. This leads to some disappointing
    situations when the last thing from the bag is a doll, and you already refused a pirate hat because hoping to get a
    train set!
</p>
<p>
    When this happened with John, his Dad told him - "Don't worry,
    I’ll teach you how to choose a better gift. Think about how many gifts are in the bag."
</p>

<p>
    You are given the number of gifts in a bag. The "bag" is a
    <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators">generator</a> with floats --
    prices for these gifts. You can iterate this generator but only once, and while you iterate the "bag", you can
    accept a current gift by calling the "accept_gift" function which is given as the third argument.

</p>

<p>
    Your function will be checked repeatedly for different bags containing anywhere from 10 to 1000 gifts. We will count
    only the best gifts from each bag as the second rate gifts are not for us.
</p>

<p>
    <strong> Input: </strong> Three arguments.<br>
    <em>total_gifts</em> - a number of gifts in a bag as an integer.<br>
    <em>bag</em> - a generator that returns a float values of gifts.<br>
    <em>accept_gift</em> - the callback function which you should call to accept gift.
</p>

<p>
    <strong> Output: </strong> It does not matter.

    <strong> How to use: </strong>
    This code can recognize optimal situations and allow you to trigger certain events during those situations. For
    example, you could create a bot that crawls a website looking for concert tickets and automatically lets you know
    when your favorite band is playing in your city.
