    <strong>Bag of Santa Claus</strong>
</p>
<p>
    When New Year is coming everybody waits the visit of Santa Claus.
    He comes with a huge bag of gifts, and you can take any.
    But how to make the best choose - so Santa gets them out of the bag one at a time,
    and if you don't like it - puts it again to bag forever.
    What a disappointment, when the last thing from the bag is a doll,
    and you have already refused to pirate hat because hoping to get a saber!
</p>
<p>
    When this happened with John, Dad told him - don't worry,
    I teach you how to choose a better gift. Did you knew how much gifts in the bag?
